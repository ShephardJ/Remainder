# Remainder
Remainder was a gamemaker 1.4,1804 project I worked on for a while by myself. It was shelved because I realised the adventure mode would not work the way the game was designed. Arcade mode is ok. designed for mobile phones primarily.

My starting point was 1) a rogue lite game for mobile phones that actually fits the platform. So it had to be:
2) playable 1 handed in vertical format
3) easy enough to read even with low brightness
4) playable without sound

Based on my personal preferences in terms of mobile gaming and also personal goals, I added to the list:
5) turn based
6) two game modes for different game session lengths(short and long)
7) limited color palette
8) use of very basic synths to make music

I will probably not respond to any pull requests and this was my second project so it's spaghetti in there.
